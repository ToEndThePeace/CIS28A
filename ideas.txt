TO DELETE OR CHANGE RECORDS IN ACCESS
    create an event with a popup window or form
    ask for admin password and validate input
  FOR THIS TO WORK
    there must be an admin table with passwords and usernames
    there must be an admin form to change passwords and add admins
    the admin table must only be editable through the form for security and data integrity

CONSIDER SOME FORM OF UPSIZING?!? (FUCK THAT WORD SUCKS)
    maybe the databases need to be stored on a server
    that would solve the problem of sharing the info and editing it?
    add a bit more overhead, increase security

LITERALLY RIGHT AFTER MY BRILLIANT FUCKING IDEA
THE NEXT PROJECT MAKES UPSIZING OBSOLETE FOR A SMALL-SCALE COMPANY
